# webApplause
This project converts the shaking of multiple phones around the web (aka applause) into OSC data for one or several performers. 

# webServerSide
This is a websocket that receives 'applause' data from multiple web instances. 
A 'applause' is generated by opening the page

	/public/index.html
	
 and shaking the phone or tapping the screen.
(There are still some permission troubles with iPhone)

A performer opens instead the page 

	/public/performer.html 
	
and receives the mean of all incoming applause. 
To route this data further to a OSC-device (eg Max4Live), see following point. 

## requirements
Download and install [(node.js)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
	
Then go to the project folder in the terminal and run:

	npm install express 
	npm install socket.io 
	
To run the app, type:
	
	node server.js
	
Note that the address of the server has to be changed in /public/sketch.js and /public/performer.js

	change address in line 11:
   	socket = io.connect('http://localhost:3000');
	
to 	
	
	socket = io.connect('http://myServerAddress:3000');
	
Also make sure the port 3000 can be used on the server. Otherwise change the port. 

# performerSide
A performer needs to download & install node.js 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Then open the terminal and go to /performerSide/ 
(you can write cd and drag the folder in the terminal)

    cd  [yourPath]/node_shake/performerSide


and run the script with

    node bridge.js


If bridge.js is running, open your OSC receiver like the given Max-Patch. 
The OSC-port to receive in Max is default on 3334. You can change it in the performer.html
